# Group-chat-App Usingh Socket Programming
A group chat application using MulticastSocket (Java Platform SE 7) class is discussed. 
A MulticastSocket is a (UDP) DatagramSocket, with additional capabilities for joining “groups” of other multicast hosts on the internet.

## Procedure
1) Save the file code.java and compile it using javac
2) Run the program using two command line arguments as specified
3) A multicast host is specified by a class D IP address and by a standard UDP port number. Class D IP addresses are in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, inclusive. The address 224.0.0.0 is reserved and should not be used.
